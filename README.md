# TypeScript Type Inference Error with Array Concatenation

This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript error related to type inference and array concatenation.  The error message indicates a type mismatch because TypeScript incorrectly infers the type of an array. 

The `bug.ts` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.ts` shows the corrected version. The problem lies in how TypeScript handles type inference when dealing with arrays, potentially leading to unexpected errors if not handled properly.
